  CSc 472 / I0500
  Computer Graphics


  Homework #1 due 3/6/19:

  * Read Chapters 1-3 in the Angel book.

  * Download CS472
    <http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~wolberg/cs472/code.html> to get a
    program that implements all of the homework problems assigned during
    this semester. Please download the version of CS472 that is suitable
    for your platform: CS472_Installer.exe (Windows), CS472.app.zip
    (Mac), or CS472.ubuntu16.10.zip (Ubuntu Linux).

    CS472 uses Qt, which is a C++ graphical user interface library for
    creating nice interfaces to support your application. We use Qt to
    allow you to easily interact with your graphics programs. You will
    be able to use widgets such as sliders, spinboxes, radio buttons,
    pushbuttons, and more to specify parameters for your homework
    assignments. CS472 also uses the OpenGL graphics library to render
    the output.

  * Download CS472.skel.zip
    <http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~wolberg/cs472/code/CS472.skel.zip> to
    get the skeleton code for creating a Qt-based application in which
    each homework assignment gets installed in a separate submenu.

    Each homework assignment will require you to implement a class
    (e.g., HW1, HW2, ...). A sample HW0 class is implemented for you to
    see several fully working implementations. The source code is in the
    CS472.skel/hw0 subdirectory. The skeleton code for the first
    homework assignment can be found in the CS472.skel/hw1 subdirectory.
    All of the Qt code necessary to collect parameters for all homeworks
    is entirely supplied to you so that you don't need to spend time on
    the graphical user interface. You only need to fill in the stubs in
    hw1/HW1*.cpp where it says "// PUT YOUR CODE HERE". Your homework
    assignment will be installed under menu HW1 in the menubar.

  * In homework 1a, write a program that partitions a window into a set
    of nine viewports (e.g., a 3x3 grid of viewports). File hw1/HW1a.cpp
    gives you a list of 16 vertices that approximate the outline of the
    letter P. In each viewport, draw that vertex list using GL_POINTS,
    GL_LINES, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_TRIANGLES,
    GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, GL_QUADS, and GL_POLYGON,
    respectively.

    The viewports should be ordered from left to right, bottom to top.
    Use the glViewport(x, y, w, h) function, where (w,h) is the viewport
    width and height, and (x,y) is the position of the bottom left
    corner of the viewport. Note that (0,0) is the bottom left corner of
    the canvas. Set the background and foreground colors to black and
    white, respectively, for all drawings. Do not use shader code for
    this assignment. Just use the supplied vector of 32 floats that
    holds the (x,y) coordinates of the 16 vertices and make calls to
    glVertex2f() to draw the data in each viewport using each of the
    nine drawing modes (e.g., GL_POINTS, GL_LINES, ...).

  * In homework 1b, write a program that draws a triangle. A slider is
    used to control the rotation angle and radio buttons are used to
    turn on/off the twist feature as discussed in class. The twist
    feature simply modifies the rotation angle of a given vertex by
    making the rotation matrix a function of angle AND distance of the
    vertex from the origin (center of widget). In order to see the twist
    effect, the triangle must be tesselated into triangular components,
    which can be produced by recursive subdivision. A slider is used to
    control the number of subdivisions. This value is only used to
    render the triangle if the twist setting is turned on by the twist
    radio button. Assign a random color to each triangular facet.

    Make sure to write (or refer to) the following functions to complete
    this assignment:
    triangle(a, b, c) should rotate/twist vertices a, b, and c. The
    three transformed vertices get pushed onto a vector called m_points.
    Each of these vertices gets the same random color assigned to it.
    Those values are pushed onto a vector called m_colors.
    divideTriangle(a, b, c, count) should recurse count times. At each
    level of recursion, the function splits one triangle into four
    triangles until the base case is reached (count reaches 0). Then,
    triangle(a, b, c) is called to save away the triangle data into
    m_points and m_colors.

    The graphical user interface code invokes changeTheta(n),
    changeSubdiv(n), and changeTwist(flag) as functions that respond to
    changes in the sliders or radio buttons. Please note that the n
    parameter is the slider value. These functions will clear the
    m_points (and possibly m_colors) vector so that new values can be
    pushed into them when processing the geometry under new GUI settings.

  * Compare your results with those of CS472, the supplied executable of
    the working programs.
